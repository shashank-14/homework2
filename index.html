    <h1>Implementing HTML Tags</h1>

    <p>This project includes various HTML tags. HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces.</p>

    <p>The HTML b tag specifies <b>bold</b> text</p>

    <p>The HTML i tag specifies <i>italic</i> text.</p>

    <blockquote>Browsers generally render blockquote text as indented text. If your
             quoted text needs to display within a non-quoted paragraph, you should use the
	              HTML q tag. Most browsers surround q text with quotation marks.</blockquote>
